# tweet-generator
Generating new tweets from existing tweets as input

## Introduction:
### Problem Statement
The popularity of social media platforms like Twitter has made it essential for
businesses and individuals to produce engaging content to attract followers. One of
the ways to produce engaging content is to generate tweets that are interesting and
informative. In this project, we aim to build a tweet generator that can generate new
tweets based on existing tweets.
### Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To preprocess and explore the given Twitter dataset
- To build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model that can generate new
tweets based on the existing tweets.
- To evaluate the performance of the RNN model and improve its accuracy.
- To generate new tweets using the trained model that are interesting and
informative.  

By achieving these objectives, we can develop a model that can generate new
tweets, thereby providing value to businesses and individuals looking to create
engaging content on social media.
### Data Preparation(Dataset)
The dataset employed in this project is Twitter Sentiment Analysis by Analytics
Vidya, which was sourced from the reputable data science platform, Kaggle. It
is comprised of 31,962 tweets, which were deemed suitable for this study. In
some cases, tweets from a particular user may not exceed 10,000, which may
not adequately satiate the data requirements of most machine learning and deep
learning models. Thus, the decision was made to utilize the aforementioned
dataset for this study.
